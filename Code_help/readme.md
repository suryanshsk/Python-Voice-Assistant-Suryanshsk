Voice-Activated Coding System

Overview

The Voice-Activated Coding System lets users generate code snippets through voice commands. By using speech recognition and OpenAI's language model, the application simplifies the coding process and makes it more interactive.

Libraries Used

speech_recognition: Converts spoken language into text.

pyttsx3: Provides text-to-speech capabilities.

openai: Interacts with OpenAI's API to generate code based on prompts.

What I Added

Error Handling: Improved responses when the system doesn't understand a command.

Exit Command: Users can say "exit" to close the application easily.

Interactive Feedback: After generating code, the system prompts users for further requests or to exit.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how combining speech recognition with AI can create a more intuitive coding experience. With its user-friendly features, the application is a solid foundation for future enhancements.
